# Title: Raineriâ€™s Constant

## For the Gameplay Programmers
Please refer to the class hierarchy diagram in the project specification: https://docs.google.com/document/d/18jdc1CTjqWHOvvTPKp3Yxa2g4ctDTjgEZDsivXsKPBI/edit?usp=sharing

I have put in place a very rigorous object hierarchy with the rationale being that abstracting the implementation of the concepts featured in the game would make the project easier to code. 

When making a contribution to the project please create your own branch listing the changes that you made so that they can be committed to the master branch by me.

Comment your code wherever possible and please use meaningful variable names that follow the convention that I've put in place
> Class names - CamelCaps
Variable Identifiers - camelCaps

## GamePlay Reminder
>  Society: The game will be set up as a society, which will initially be run autonomously by NPCs who can be replaced by players.
Time Travel: Events will be set up allowing players to go back to when decisions were made and will be given an option to alter history in order to gain access to an alternate reality. Each reality iteration deviates from the next through decisions made in particular events.
Massively multiplayer: Players or different abilities and game progress will interact with each other.

## For the Network Programmers
